# Overview
  In each election, political organizations focus on only a handful of House races. While it seems to be the same races every cycle, some swing more dramatically than others. The problem is that when large national organizations are deciding where to put their resources and money, it matters whether a house race can be won. Putting funds into the wrong races could be the difference between losing or winning the House. I will conduct historical analysis of house races. By analyzing the range of outcomes can we predict which races are the most likely to be competitive in 2024? 
  
# Context
  Elections continue to get more expensive; each election cycle sets a record for being the most expensive cycle. National organizations play a key role in determining where those funds are spent. Millions of dollars are paid to strategists to attempt to determine which races are able to be swayed. Putting money in the wrong race could affect not only that race but others. With so many variables, this is a problem that is incredibly hard to quantify.
  
  With the difficulty of determining where to distribute funds, any small insights could lead to large changes. Ideally, these insights would lead to a more efficient use of funds and resources in order to be more competitive. The ability to find races that have the potential to be flipped that are currently unknown, could also aid the parties.

# Proposal
  The question that I hope to answer using machine learning is, can we predict which races are the most likely to be competitive in 2024? Through a combination of machine learning and data analysis, by looking at past House races I hope to determine what factors lead to more competitive races. The first step will be creating a dataset that contains pertinent features from past house races. Then, that data will be tested on multiple models to gain valuable insights about the effects of individual features. By first looking at past house races, and attempting to determine the effects of features, the insights gained can be applied to a model for the upcoming election cycle. 
  
  The outcome variable that will attempt to be modeled is a competitiveness scale. The scale will attempt to articulate in an interpretable manner, how close the 2024 race in each house district will be. The features that will be included to model the outcome variable on will include data on past House races. For example, campaign spending, demographics, previous election results, if there was an incumbent. Another feature that could be included would be the state in which the house district is in. An interesting feature that could also be valuable would be the ease of voting in the state. This is a metric that many NGOs have attempted to quantify to grade countries and states, but could be applied here.
  
  By including these and hopefully other features of impact, I hope to gain insight into how these factors affect House races. Specifically, the variables of spending could be massively consequential if there is a way to quantify the correlation between competitiveness and spending. The interaction of several of these variables could also be important. The final goal would be to determine a few house districts for the upcoming election cycle that might not be thought of as competitive but have the potential to be close.a

# Conclusion
  With the massive role that large political organizations play in determining where funds are spent and campaigns only getting more expensive, it is more important than ever to be able to better target spending on the most competitive house districts. By looking at a variety of features related to a house campaign, I hope to be able to better determine where funding and resources could have the greatest impact. 
  
  If able to quantify, the effect of spending on campaigns could be applied to other political contexts. While it might not be directly applied, the insights on how targeted spending can shift public opinion can be consequential in many other fields as well. The one area that comes to mind specifically is governments attempting to shift public support or knowledge on specific topics.
  
  As this project will attempt to quantify a topic that has been incredibly difficult to, it will not likely succeed in determining the effect of all or any of the features that will be explored. Any insights that are discovered will need to be closely examined and considered as this data has a strong likelihood of leaking. That said, any number of these features have been and can be studied in a much greater depth to better understand their true impact.
