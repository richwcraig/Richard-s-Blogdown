1.Opening:
  
  Oregon sees itself as a something special in terms of politics and as a lifelong Oregonian, I like to believe that as well. However, the factors that affect the rest of the U.S. still seen in Oregon. Whether that be the continued polarization of the rural or urban divide, or the fight for the suburbs, Oregon is not too unlike most other states. One area that Oregon excels is our political participation and its' ease to do so. 
  
  In 2016, Oregon took another step towards making it easier to vote with the passage of the Motor Voter Act. This law shifted voter registration through the DMV to an opt-out system from an opt-in system. This system has drastically changed the number of Oregonians that have registered and shifted what they register as. Since 2016, Third-party and non-party registration has exploded to the point that voters that are not affiliated with any party has become the plurality of the Oregon electorate. 
  
  Oregon has not been seen as a competitive state, and this is reflected on our Elections. In the 2020 General Election, there were 16 state senate races and of those, the result was within five points in only four of the races. In the end though, Democrats held their majority of 18 to 12. This historical dominance is no different with the Democrats controlled the Senate for the last 9 election cycles. The broader story is one of Oregon politics is not a particularly dynamic one. However, this does not need to be the case. 
  
2.A Case for Change.
  
  Oregon is one of 12 states in the United States that has solely closed primaries. Closed primaries where only registered members of the party can vote for candidates in the primary election. This is where the most potential for change lies. With the majority of voters not registered with either of the two parties, if activists could get a small percentage of non-affiliated voters to register, there is a potential to change the candidates that will run and likely win the general elections. To begin to understand just how voter registration will change in the next year and a half, five districts in Oregon were selected. Using those five districts as bellwethers, I was able to forecast their registration makeup for the 2022 election. 
  
3.Representative Districts:

The 23rd and 30th Senate Districts
  
  These two districts represent how most casual observers of Oregon politics perceive the entire system. The 23rd State Senate District is the most urban district in all of Oregon. Located in northeast Portland, it is by far the smallest of all of Oregon’s senate districts due to its high housing density. This District has not had a legitimate challenger to the Democrat senator since the district was moved from southern Oregon in 2003 during redistricting. Since then, the Democrat has received at least 80% of the vote. 
  
  The 30th State Senate District is much the same story but on the opposite end of spectrum. It is the most rural district in all of Oregon, consisting of over 36% of the total area of the state. Like the 23rd district, it has be almost entirely uncontested for the last 20 years. 
    
The 7th and 8th Senate Districts
  
  These two districts are of particular interest as they are two most racial and housing density representative districts in all of Oregon. Like the other two districts that have been discussed, they have also not had strongly contested elections in the last decade. However, they are representative the median of the rest of the state. Democrats are in a strong majority, followed closely by non-affiliated voters, followed by Republicans. 
    
The 10th Senate District
  
  The final district that was investigated, was the 10th senate district. It was chosen primarily due to the author having lived in it his entire life. However, it also represents one of Oregon’s increasingly rare toss-up districts. In the 2020 election, a Democrat was elected to the district for the first time since 2002. However, that is due to a Republican incumbent holding the seat who had incredibly high name recognition and being relatively moderate. Even with both those factors, in 2018, the Republican only one by 8 points. Many of the previous elections had similar results. This district is also one of the closest districts in terms of registration. Roughly one-third of the voters are Republican, with another third being Democrats and the final third being mostly non-affiliated but also third parties. 
    
4. Conclusion
  
  Each of these districts were chosen as they represented a particular characteristic of Oregon politics but what was learned that the trends that are seen across Oregon are also happening in each of these districts. In each of these districts nonaffiliated voters are projected to grow on average of about 5%. When you compare this to the forecasted continued decline of the two major parties, this is surprising. As the size of the electorate will remain relatively stable, the votes of non-affiliated voters will become increasingly valuable. 
  
  The votes could be incredibly important especially in the low turnout elections of the primaries. With turnout in the last primary election being somewhere around 60% in each of these districts, the potential for new voters to shift elections is within the realm of possibilities. However, that means that these voters who are apathetic at best, will need to take the step to register with one of the two major parties. 
  
  Oregon parties could also take the step to open their parties’ primary elections. This is not without precedent; a bill was introduced in the 2017 Legislative session to do just that. Open primaries also have the potential to produce candidates that are more moderate and thus more in line with the vast majority of the voting public. https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/07/01/open-primaries-thad-cochran-mississippi-editorials-debates/11938275/
